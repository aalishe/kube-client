# A Simple Kubernetes Client in Go

This package is part of the blog article [Building a Kubernetes Client in Go](http://blog.johandry.com/post/kubernetes_client/).

This is a work in progress, until `patch()` is not done the `Apply()` will fail.

## TODO

- [ ] Complete the `patch()` method
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Add more ~simple~ features
